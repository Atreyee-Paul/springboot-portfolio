          Hi there! I‚Äôm a curious and creative Computer Science student who loves exploring the
          world of programming and technology.  
          From building machine learning models to developing full-stack applications, I enjoy
          turning ideas into fun and meaningful solutions.  
          I approach every challenge like a playful cat ‚Äî curious, persistent, and always ready to
          learn something new. üêæ  
          Outside of code, I enjoy experimenting with new concepts, discovering music, and
          adding a little creativity to everything I do.
